This branch contains the qmail-queue-custom-error patch

Adds the possibility for a qmail-queue-replacement to offer custom
error (=bounce) messages.

You have to write the error message to filedescriptor 4 and exit 82, 
in order to use the custom message. Format of the message:

Dthis is a custom fatal error message
Zthis is a custom temporary failure message

Thanks to Richard Lyons <frob-qmail webcentral.com.au> for spotting a 
wrong errstr declaration.

Thanks to Jeremy Hinton for noting to include the patch to qmail.h

This patch has been made by Flavio Curti <fcu-software at no-way.org> and is
provided AS IS. Do with it as you wish, I'm not responsible for anything that
breaks because of this patch.

EXAMPLES

Perl:
open(FD,">&4");
print FD "Ztemporary failure message";
close(FD);
exit(82);

Shell:
echo -n "Zpermanent failure after data" >&4
exit 82;

C (non-djb-style):
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

char    err[] = "Zpermanently refusing";

int main() {
        write(4,err,(strlen(err)+1));
        exit(82);
}
