This branch contains the sendmail -f patch

Fix qmail's sendmail emulation flag -f
David Phillips noticed that qmail's sendmail emulation doesn't correctly
support the -f flag as it should. Scripts may rely on this flag (it sets
the envelope sender address - the address where delivery problems are sent
to unless the message also contains an Errors-To: message header).
