This branch contains the smtpd-502-to-500 patch

Fix qmail-smtpd so that it responds with a 500 error code to unrecognized
SMTP commands instead of a 502 error code (aka RFC2821)

This patch modifies the behavior of qmail-smtpd so that it responds with a 500
error code to unrecognized SMTP commands instead of a 502 error code. It's a
minor distinction, but RFC2821 (published several years after the current
version of qmail) said that's the way it should be done. Which, unless you
have a good reason, RFC SHOULD's mean just that. Since it's trivial, here it
is. This patch was written by Jonathan de Boyne Pollard.
