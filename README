This branch contains RFC2821 support for qmail-remote

This patch fixes a problem with how qmail handles deliveries to domains which
have multiple MX records. Normally qmail tries to connect to the various MX
servers, but the first server it successfully connects to ends up being the
only one it ever tries.

I've modified the patch so that both 4xx and 5xx messages result in the next
MX record being tried.
