This branch contains the qmail-1.03.qmtpd-netstring.patch

This patch corrects a programming error in
the getlen() and main() routines of qmail-qmtpd.c.

These routines read input length in netstring format.
But the original code does not test for numeric validity
in the length field of the netstring.

As a consquence, it is possible for an attacker to design
input to create a buffer overflow.

This patch modifies the original to perform validity
checking when reading the length field of the netstring.
