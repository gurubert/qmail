This branch contains the qmail-1.03-fastremote-3 patch

While sending individual messages with qmail consumes very little CPU,
sending multiple large messages in parallel can effectively DoS a sender
due to inefficiencies in qmail-remote's "blast" function.  In its
original form, this function scans the message one byte at a time to
escape leading periods and newlines, as required by SMTP.

This patch modifies blast to scan the message in larger chunks.  I have
benchmarked before and after, and the change reduced the CPU time
consumed by qmail-remote by a factor of 10.

The original version of this patch had two bugs that would corrupt data
for any message larger than 4kB.
