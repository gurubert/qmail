Here is a little patch by Frank DENIS aka Jedi/Sector One <j@4u.net> to
limit the size of bounces.
The default limit for bounces is 50000 bytes, but you can create a file in
/var/qmail/crontrol/bouncemaxbytes (or wherever your control directory is)
in order to change that number.

Comment (eh):
No default restriction here. A bouncemaxbytes value of '0' correspondes
to unrestricted bounce size.
