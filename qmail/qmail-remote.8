.SH NAME
qmail-remote \- send mail via SMTP or QMTP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qmail-remote
.I host
.I sender
.I recip
[
.I recip ...
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B qmail-remote
reads a mail message from its input
and sends the message
to one or more recipients
at a remote host.

The remote host is
.BR qmail-remote 's
first argument,
.IR host .
.B qmail-remote
sends the message to
.IR host ,
or to a mail exchanger for
.I host
listed in the Domain Name System,
via the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP/ESMTP) 
perhaps encrypted via STARTTLS/TLS
or the Quick Mail Transfer Protocol (QMTP).
.I host
can be either a fully-qualified domain name:

.EX
     silverton.berkeley.edu
.EE

or an IP address enclosed in brackets:

.EX
     [128.32.183.163]
.EE
 
In case the primary mail exchanger for that Domain
will issue a 5xy reply message during the connection,
.B qmail-remote
will contact all responsible mail exchangers in turn
in order to deliver the message anyway.

The envelope recipient addresses are listed as
.I recip
arguments to
.BR qmail-remote .
The envelope sender address is listed as
.I sender\fP.

Note that
.B qmail-remote
does not take options
and does not follow the
.B getopt
standard.

.SH TRANSPARENCY
End-of-file in SMTP is encoded as dot CR LF.
A dot at the beginning of a line is encoded as dot dot.
It is impossible in SMTP to send a message that does not end with a newline.
.B qmail-remote
converts the UNIX newline convention into the SMTP newline convention
by inserting CR before each LF.

It is a violation of the SMTP protocol
to send a message that contains long lines or non-ASCII characters.
However,
.B qmail-remote
will happily send such messages.
It is the user's responsibility to avoid generating illegal messages.
.SH "RESULTS"
.B qmail-remote
prints some number of 
.I recipient reports\fP,
followed by a
.I message report\fR.
Each report is terminated by a 0 byte.
Each report begins with a single letter:
.TP 5
r
Recipient report: acceptance.
.TP 5
h
Recipient report: permanent rejection.
.TP 5
s
Recipient report: temporary rejection.
.TP 5
K
Message report: success.
.I host
has taken responsibility for delivering the message to each
acceptable recipient.
.TP 5
Z
Message report: greylisted or temporary failure.
.TP 5
D
Message report: permanent failure.
.PP
After this letter comes a human-readable description of
what happened.

.B qmail-remote
may use SMTP Authenticaton to connect to remote hosts.
The following reports are provided:
.TP 5
K
no supported AUTH method found, continuing without authentication.
.TP 5
Z
Connected to 
.I host
but authentication was rejected (AUTH PLAIN).
.TP 5

.I host
but unable to base64encode username+digest.
.TP 5
Z

.I host
but authentication was rejected (username+digest).
.PP
The recipient reports will always be printed in the same order as
.BR qmail-remote 's
.I recip
arguments.
Note that in failure cases there may be fewer
recipient reports
than
.I recip
arguments.
.PP
In case a CNAME can not be resovled 
.B qmail-remote
issues the following message:
.TP 5
Z
CNAME lookup failed temporarily for:
.IR host . 
.PP
If a SMTP connection is bound to a none-existing IP address
.B qmail-remote
will complain with the message:
.TP 5
Z
System resources temporarily unavailable.
.PP
In case a QMTP connection can not be established 
.B qmail-remote
will issue the error message:
.TP 5
Z 
recipient
.I host
did not talk proper QMTP.
.PP
On demand
.B qmail-remote
supports TLS/STARTTLS and will use the following messages:
.TP 5

.TP 5
<<<<<<< HEAD
.I authsenders
Authenticated sender.
For each
.I sender 
included in 
.IR authsenders :
.I sender\fB:\fIrelay\fB:\fIport\fB|\fIuser\fB|\fIpassword 
.B qmail-remote
will try SMTP Authentication 
of type CRAM-MD5, LOGIN, or PLAIN 
with the provided user name
.I user 
and password
.I password 
(the authentication information) 
and eventually relay the 
mail through
.I relay
on port
.IR port .
The use of 
.I relay
and 
.I port 
follows the same rules as for
.IR smtproutes 
Note: In case
.I sender
is empty, 
.B qmail-remote
will try to deliver each outgoing mail 
SMTP authenticated. If the authentication
information is missing, the mail is 
delivered none-authenticated.
.I authsenders
can be constructed as follows:

.EX
   @example.com:relay.example.com|user|passwd
   info@example.com:relay.example.com:26|infouser|infopasswd
   :mailrelay.example.com|e=mc2|testpass
.EE
.TP 5
.I domaincerts
In case
.B qmail-remote
needs to present a client certificate to the server 
(for authentication purposes) the PEM encoded 
X.509 certificate can be provided per sending domain:
.IR domain\fB:\fIcertificate\fB|\fIkeyfile\fB|\fIpassword .
If 
.I domain
equals '*' this
.I certificate
is used as default.
The file 
.I certificate 
may include the private key, thus 
.I keyfile
can be ommitted. Additionally, the private key can be protected with a
.IR password .

.TP 5
.I domainips
IP addresses to be used on outgoing connections.
Each line has the form
.IR senddomain\fB:\fIlocalip ,
without any extra spaces.
If
.I domain
matches the domain part in
.IR sender ,
.B qmail-remote
will bind to
.IR localip
when connecting to
.IR host .
If it matches, it will also set the HELO string to the domain part of
.IR sender .
=======
.I bindroutes
Artificial interface binding routes for IPv4 addresses.
Each route has the form
.IR remote-IPv4-address\fB|\fIlocal-IPv4-address ,
without any extra spaces.
If the IPv4 address of the host to which we are delivering matches the remote
IPv4 address, then bind the socket to the interface matching the local
IPv4 address, making it appear as if the connection had originated from the
named local IPv4 address instead of the default local IPv4 address.
.I bindroutes
may contain suffix wildcards.

Send this on the internal net
.EX
   10.|10.0.0.1
.EE

Rest goes on external
.B mail
address (yes, its bogus!)
.EX
   |301.32.1.1
.EE

Hey, we could
.B cheat
on stopping qmail-remote sending to this host
.EX
   555.123.123.123|this-isnt-an-ipv4-address
.EE

.IR bindroutes
takes precedence over
.IR outgoingip
in IPv4 network.
.TP 5
.I bindroutes6
Artificial interface binding routes for IPv6 addresses.
Each route has the form
.IR remote-IPv6-address\fB|\fIlocal-IPv6-address ,
without any extra spaces.
If the IPv6 address of the host to which we are delivering matches the remote
IPv6 address, then bind the socket to the interface matching the local
IPv6 address, making it appear as if the connection had originated from the
named local IPv6 address instead of the default local IPv6 address.
.I bindroutes6
may contain suffix wildcards.

Send this on the internal net
.EX
   2001:|2001:db8::1
.EE

Rest goes on external
.B mail
address (yes, its bogus!)
.EX
   |1100:2200:3300::4

.EX
   1100:2200:3300:4400:|this-isnt-an-ipv6-address
.EE

.IR bindroutes6
takes precedence over
.IR outgoingip6
in IPv6 network.
.TP 5
.I domainbindings
Local IPv4 bindings based on envelope sender domain.
Each binding has the form
.IR domain\fB|\fIlocal-IPv4-address ,
without any extra spaces.
If
.I domain
matches
.IR host ,
.B qmail-remote
will bind the local side of the socket for the outgoing IPv4 connection to
.IR local-IPv4-address .
.I local-IPv4-address
may be empty;
this tells
.B qmail-remote
to let the OS choose the local IPv4 address for outgoing connections as usual.
.I domainbindings
may include wildcards:

.EX
   example.com|5.6.7.8
   .example.com|5.6.7.9
   heaven.af.mil|1.2.3.4
.EE

Here the IPv4 connection for any message with an envelope sender address
ending with
.B .example.com
(but not
.B example.com
itself)
is bound to local IPv4 address
.BR 5.6.7.9 ,
while envelope senders in
.B example.com
are bound to
.BR 5.6.7.8 ,
and senders in
.B heaven.af.mil
are bound to
.BR 1.2.3.4 .
All other outgoing IPv4 connections (including messages with the null
return-path)
use the OS-chosen default local IPv4 address. The
.B qmail
system does not protect you if you specify an invalid local IPv4 address to
bind to.

.IR domainbindings
takes precedence over
.IR bindroutes
and
.IR outgoingip .
.TP 5
.I domainbindings6
Local IPv6 bindings based on envelope sender domain.
Each binding has the form
.IR domain\fB|\fIlocal-IPv6-address ,
without any extra spaces.
If
.I domain
matches
.IR host ,
.B qmail-remote
will bind the local side of the socket for the outgoing IPv6 connection to
.IR local-IPv6-address .
.I local-IPv6-address
may be empty;
this tells
.B qmail-remote
to let the OS choose the local IPv6 address for outgoing connections as usual.
.I domainbindings6
may include wildcards:

.EX
   example.com|1100:2200:3300::8
   .example.com|1100:2200:3300::9
   heaven.af.mil|1100:2200:3300::4
.EE

Here the IPv6 connection for any message with an envelope sender address
ending with
.B .example.com
(but not
.B example.com
itself)
is bound to local IPv6 address
.BR 1100:2200:3300::9 ,
while envelope senders in
.B example.com
are bound to
.BR 1100:2200:3300::8 ,
and senders in
.B heaven.af.mil
are bound to
.BR 1100:2200:3300::4 .
All other outgoing IPv6 connections (including messages with the null
return-path)
use the OS-chosen default local IPv6 address. The
.B qmail
system does not protect you if you specify an invalid local IPv6 address to
bind to.

.IR domainbindings6
takes precedence over
.IR bindroutes6
and
.IR outgoingip6 .
>>>>>>> ipv6
.TP 5
.I helohost
Current host name,
for use solely in saying hello to the remote SMTP server.
Default:
.IR me ,
if that is supplied;
otherwise
.B qmail-remote
refuses to run.  If the envelope sender address matches a domain in the
.IR domainbindings
control file for IPv4 connections, the envelope sender domain will be used
instead of this value.  Likewise for IPv6 connections, if the envelope sender
address matches a domain in the
.IR domainbindings6
control file, the envelope sender domain will be used instead of this value.
If the local IP binding matches the one in the
.I helohostbindings
control file, then the matched name in the
.I helohostbindings
will be used instead.
.TP 5
.I helohostbindings
Local helo name bindings based on local IP bind used by
.IR bindroutes ,
.IR bindroutes6 ,
.IR outgoingip ,
.IR outgoingip6 ,
.IR domainbindings ,
and
.IR domainbindings6 .
Each binding has the form
.IR local-ip\fB|\fIhelodomain ,
without any extra spaces.  If
.IR local-ip
matches the binded IP except 0.0.0.0 for IPv4 or 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0 for IPv6
(system default),
.BR qmail-remote
will set the helo name to
.IR helodomain
instead of default
.IR me .
Example:

.EX
   5.6.7.8|host1.example.com
   5.6.7.9|host2.example.com
.EE

If there is a local IP bind used by
.IR bindroutes
,
.IR bindroutes6
,
.IR outgoingip
,
.IR outgoingip6
,
.IR domainbindings
or
.IR domainbindings6
, will trigger
.IR helohostbindings .
If local IP is bound to
.BR 5.6.7.8 ,
then
.BR qmail-remote
will set the helo name to
.BR host1.example.com .
Likewise for
.BR 5.6.7.9
will set the helo name to
.BR host2.example.com .
.TP 5
.I outgoingip
IPv4 address to be used on outgoing IPv4 connections.
Default: system-defined.
The value
.IR 0.0.0.0
is equivalent to the system default.
.TP 5
.I outgoingip6
IPv6 address to be used on outgoing IPv6 connections.
Default: system-defined.
The value
.IR 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0
is equivalent to the system default.
.TP 5
.I qmtproutes
Additional QMTP routes which have precedence over
.IR smtproutes .
QMTP routes should obey the form
.IR domain\fB:\fIrelay\fB:\fIport ,
without any extra spaces.
.I qmtproutes
follows the same syntax as
.IR smtproutes .
By default, 
.B qmail-remote
connects to QMTP service port 209. However
you can chose a dedicated high-port for QMTP communication
as defined in
.IR qmtproutes .
.TP 5
.I smtproutes
Artificial SMTP routes.
Each route has the form
.I domain\fB:\fIrelay 
or 
.I domain\fB:\fIrelay\fB|\fIuser\fB|\fIpassword
without any extra spaces.
If
.I domain
matches
.IR host ,
.B qmail-remote
will connect to
.IR relay ,
as if
.I host
had
.I relay
as its only MX.
(It will also avoid doing any CNAME lookups on
.IR recip .)
.I host
may include a colon and a port number to use instead of the
normal SMTP port, 25. In case, a userid and password is
present,
.B qmail-remote
will try a SMTP authenticated session:

.EX
   inside.af.mil:firewall.af.mil:26
   :submission.myrelay.com:587|myuserid|mypasswd
.EE

.I relay
may be empty;
this tells
.B qmail-remote
to look up MX records as usual.
.I smtproutes
may include wildcards:

.EX
   .af.mil:
   :heaven.af.mil
.EE

Here
any address ending with
.B .af.mil
(but not
.B af.mil
itself)
is routed by its MX records;
any other address is artificially routed to
.BR heaven.af.mil .

Additionally,
.I smtproutes 
allows to forward bounces (with a 'Nullsender' MAIL FROM: <>)
literally expressed as '!@'
to a particular bounce host:

.EX
   !@:bouncehost.af.mil:27
.EE

The
.B qmail
system does not protect you if you create an artificial
mail loop between machines.
However,
you are always safe using
.I smtproutes
if you do not accept mail from the network.
.TP 5
.I timeoutconnect
Number of seconds
.B qmail-remote
will wait for the remote SMTP server to accept a connection.
Default: 60.
The kernel normally imposes a 75-second upper limit.
.TP 5
.I timeoutremote
Number of seconds
.B qmail-remote
will wait for each response from the remote SMTP server.
Default: 1200.
.TP 5
.I tlsdestinations
If present, this file advices
.B qmail-remote
to use TLS encryption for specific destination domains
as provided by the forward-path and perhaps to validate/verify 
the domain's server certificate:
.IR destination:cafile|verifydepth:port|ciphers|senddomain .
Unless explicitely configured,
.B qmail-remote 
accepts any or no certificate provided by the server,
thus uses TLS for encryption only.
Example:

.EX
  *:
  .example.com:
  securityfirst.com:/etc/ssl/cafile||!SSLv2:HIGH
  .remote.com:/etc/ssl/certdir/|3:465
  mx.partner.com:/etc/ssl/partnerca||:26|mydomain.net
  =mx.myfriend.com:/etc/ssl/cacert|4
  -.adhonlydomain.com:|aNULL:!kRSA
  =*:
  hiddenpartner.org:||:35 
  !nosslhost.example.com:
.EE

This first line tells
.B qmail-remote
to use STARTTLS to any TLS capable ESMTP server.
The second line requires from
.B qmail-remote 
to demand a STARTTLS connection for any destination
address targeting domain
.IR .example.com .
The third line accepts STARTTLS connections
for
.I securityfirst.com
only, if the X.509 certificate can be verified against
the CA cert as provided via
.I /etc/ssl/cafile 
and with the acceptable ciphers 
.IR SSLv2:HIGH
Line number four tells 
.B qmail-remote
to use a 
.I SMTPS
connection on port
.I 465
to any host at
.I .remote.com
and accept this host only, if the peer's cert
can be verified against a (hashed) CA cert available 
in
.I /etc/ssl/certdir/
and does not exceed a verification depth of
.IR 3 .
Line 5 shows an example, how 
.I tlsdestinations
can be bound exclusively to a sender domain. In this case,
only if
.I mx.mydomain.net
is used as sender domain, 
a connection for the destination address
.I mx.partner.com
is mandatory secured by TLS with a CA cert available as
.I /etc/ssl/partnerca 
with a verification depth of
.IR 2 .
Furthermore, if 
.B qmail-remote
sees a destination address concatinated with a 
.I = 
it will only accept the certificate,
if the X.509's DN can be validated
against the FQDN of the server (by means of a DNS lookup)
and it verifies against the 
.IR cacert
CA  certificate and does not exeed a verification depth of
.IR 1 .
In case, no perticular ciphers or CA certs are
required, a double-colon '::' can be used as shortcut
followed by the
.IR port .
In the same sense, 
.B qmail-remote
may accept TLS connections based on Anonymous DH (ADH)
where the server does not provide a cert for authentication
once the domain name is prepended with a 
.IR - .
Here, a wildcard '*' for the domain name is allowed.
.B qmail-remote 
will announce 
.I ADH aNULl 
as key encryption cipher and discards 
.I !RSA
for authentication if told so.
Finally, the last line instructs
.B qmail-remote
to ommit the STARTTLS command for the recipient address
.I nosslhost.example.com 
as indicated with a leading 
.IR ! .
If
.I port
equals 465, SMTPS will be used instead of STARTTLS.

Note that 'destination' is subject of the
forwarding rules as provided by
.IR authsenders ,
.IR qmtproutes  ,
and
.IR smtproutes .
