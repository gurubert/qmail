Bruce Guenther's "Bigtodo" patch:

Note to readers: After you apply this patch, your queue will no longer
be readable in its current state.  So, either install this into
/var/qmail2 and run both qmails until the queue is emptied on the old
one, or else accept that your current queue will have to be destroyed
and ``rm -rf /var/qmail/queue; make setup''.
