.SH NAME
qmail-popup \- read a POP username and password
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qmail-popup
.I hostname
.I subprogram
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B qmail-popup
reads a POP username and password from the network.
It then runs
.IR subprogram .

.B qmail-popup
typically from
.B tcpserver  
as

.EX
   tcpserver 0 pop3 qmail-popup CHANGEME checkpassword qmail-pop3d Maildir
.EE

with
CHANGEME
replaced by the fully qualified domain name of the local host.

.B qmail-popup
expects descriptor 0 to read from the network
and descriptor 1 to write to the network.
It reads a username and password from descriptor 0
in POP's USER-PASS style or APOP style.
File descriptor 5 is used to provide additional logging.
It invokes
.IR subprogram ,
with the same descriptors 0 and 1;
descriptor 2 writing to the network;
and descriptor 3 reading the username, a 0 byte, the password,
another 0 byte, 
an APOP timestamp derived from
.IR hostname ,
and a final 0 byte.
.B qmail-popup
then waits for
.I subprogram
to finish.
It prints an error message if
.I subprogram
crashes or exits nonzero.

.B qmail-popup
should be used only within
a secure network.
Otherwise an eavesdropper can steal passwords.
Even if you use APOP,
an active attacker can still take over the connection
and wreak havoc.

However, 
.B qmail-popup
can be adviced to use a TLS encrypted session by means of the environment variable UCSPITLS.
In this case,
.B qmail-popup
communicates with
.B sslserver
instead of the
.B tcpserver 
program interface through a control socket, a reading and a writing pipe dynamically
defined during the session start to be used for transport layer encryption.

.B qmail-popup
has a 20-minute idle timeout.

.SH "LOGGING"
.B qmail-popup
provides logging of accepted and rejected POP3 sessions
using about the same format as
.BR qmail-smtpd .
The authentication mechanism is indicated via
.I User 
in case the userid/password method was used, and
.I Apop
if APOP challenge/response was applicable.
The communication protocol may be either
.I POP3
or 
.I POP3S
for of a STLS secured connection.
The
.I  username
provided for authentication is displayed after the 
sequence 
.IR '?=' .


The log is available on file descriptor 5. 
In order to display the result use the redirection '5>&1'.

.B qmail-popup
is based on a program contributed by Russ Nelson.
